# Probability-Bound-Analysis-Web-Application-for-confusion-matrix
This repository contains a web based application that integrates Probability Bound Analysis into the computation of parameters from a confusion matrix i.e. sensitivity, specificity, ppv etc.
In medical diagnostics, a confusion matrix is usually used to determine the performance of a medical test after a gold standard biopsy test. However, the diesease being diagnosed might be rare, hence the quality of data available may not give a robust indication on the performance of the medical test. In this project, the theory of imprecise probability is integrated into the computing the parameters of a confusion matrix. Thus, confidence intervals, that takes into account scarsity of data are being computed using this approach.
